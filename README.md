# Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 Key Generator
## Why?
I bumped into [FlyTech's Video](https://youtu.be/3DCEeASKNDk) and at the end of the video he challenged the viewers to make a program to generate the keys, so I tried, and this is the result. The code isn't optimal but it works (I made it in about an hour).

## More info
You can check out my JavaScript version [[HERE]](https://github.com/nilaerdna/windows95keygen/).

## How to use itng fancy, just rewrote the Python code with the matching Ja?
1. Run the code.
2. When prompted type what type of code you want to be generated. ("normal" or "oem").
3. Then a file (key.txt) will be created with the code in it. 

### This code is only for educational purposes, piracy is not okay, buy the software you are using.
