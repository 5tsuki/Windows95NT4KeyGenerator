# Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 Key Generator
## Why?
I bumped into [FlyTech's Video](https://youtu.be/3DCEeASKNDk) and at the end of the video he challenged the viewers to make a program to generate the keys, so I tried, and this is the result. The code isn't optimal but it works.

------------

**I tried it on:**
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server (4.00.1381.1)
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation (4.00.1381.1) [OEM]
- Microsoft Windows 95C (4.03.1216.OSR2.5) [OEM]

### Some background
The activation key is not checked via server but with an algorithm and when the Windows NT 4.0 code was leaked they figured out how the algorithm worked.

## How does it work?
When prompted type what type of code you want to be generated. ("normal" or "oem")

### This code is only for educational purposes, piracy is not okay, buy the software you are using.
